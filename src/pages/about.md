title: About - AI Systems Architecture
---

I work as an **AI Systems Architect**, focused on how AI systems are designed, integrated, and operated in practice.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- system architecture  
- infrastructure and execution constraints  
- long-term reliability  
- decision-making under uncertainty  

I spend most of my time analyzing systems that appear to work on the surface but fail under scale, integration, or time.

This site reflects that focus.
