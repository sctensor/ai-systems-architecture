title: About - AI Systems Architecture
---

I work as an **AI systems architect**, focused on how AI systems are designed, integrated, and operated in real environments.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- system architecture  
- infrastructure and execution constraints  
- long-term reliability  
- decision-making under uncertainty  

I spend most of my time examining systems that appear functional at first glance, but fail under scale, integration pressure, or prolonged use. The emphasis is not on models or tools, but on how architectural decisions compound over time.

This site reflects that focus.
