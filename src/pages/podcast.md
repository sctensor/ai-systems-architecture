title: Podcast - AI Systems Architecture
---

The podcast explores **AI systems from an architectural perspective**.

Each episode examines a system as a whole: how it is structured, how it operates in practice, and where it tends to fail. The emphasis is on understanding real behavior rather than idealized designs.

Common themes include:
- mismatches between intended and actual system behavior  
- early bottlenecks that constrain scale  
- failure modes that emerge slowly and silently  
- architectural decisions that look reasonable but compound risk  

The discussions are analytical and system-focused, not tool-driven.
