title: Writing - AI Systems Architecture
---

Writing here focuses on **architecture-level thinking** about AI systems.

The emphasis is on clarity, structure, and judgment rather than commentary or trend analysis. Topics center on how systems are designed, how decisions propagate through them, and why certain architectural patterns repeatedly fail or succeed.

Long-form writing will appear here as discrete, deliberate publications.
