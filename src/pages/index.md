# AI Systems Architecture  
**Understanding How AI Systems Behave in the Real World**

I work at the systems and architecture layer of AI.

This work focuses on how AI systems behave beyond the model: in production environments, under real constraints, and over time. The emphasis is on architecture, execution tradeoffs, and failure modes that are not visible in demos or benchmarks.

Topics I spend time on include:
- End-to-end AI system architecture  
- Latency, cost, and throughput tradeoffs  
- Degradation, drift, and operational failure modes  
- Where human judgment remains essential in AI systems  

> *The model is rarely the problem. The system usually is.*

This site serves as a reference point for my work across audio, writing, and research.
