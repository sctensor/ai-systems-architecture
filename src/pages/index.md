# AI Systems Architecture

## Thinking in Public About How Systems Actually Break

I work at the systems and architecture layer of AI — where models meet infrastructure, incentives, latency, cost, and failure modes.

This work is not about tools or demos. It is about end-to-end systems: how they behave in production, where they degrade silently, and why many "working" AI products fail under scale, integration, or time.

My focus areas include:

* AI system architecture and execution tradeoffs
* Bottlenecks, drift, and hidden failure modes
* Where human judgment still matters in AI systems
* How teams misallocate effort when building AI products

We don't talk about models. We tear down systems.

Primary outputs:

* Podcast: AI Architecture & Systems Teardowns
* Writing: Condensed volumes derived from podcast seasons
* Research: Exploratory work in AI/ML systems (non-commercial)

This site exists as a canonical reference for that work.
